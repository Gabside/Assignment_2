        <li>1 orange bell pepper seeded and cored</li> 
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <p><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li></p>
       <p><li>Cut bell peppers into fourths and place on a cookie sheet lined with foil, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Roast 20 minutes. Remove bell peppers from the oven and immediately place in a large bowl covered with foil. Allow peppers to steam for 2 to 3 minutes. The peelings should easily come off once cooled. Discard peelings.</li></p>
       <p><li>While bell peppers are roasting, add sun-dried tomatoes, along with oil from the jar, and garlic to a medium skillet, sauté on medium-low heat until tomatoes soften up, about 4 minutes. Add basil, toss just until wilted, remove from heat, drain oil and add vinegar, stir to combine. Cool 5 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add cooled roasted bell peppers, black pepper and sun-dried tomato mixture to a food processor. Pulse until all ingredients are combined and sauce is a smooth consistency. Store sauce in a glass jar with lid in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</li></p>
    </ol>
